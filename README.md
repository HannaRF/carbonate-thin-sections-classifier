# 1. Introduction

## The Challenge

The task consists of classifying lithologies in petrographic thin-section images of synthetic carbonate rocks generated by a GAN model trained using real Petrobras data.

The goal is to develop a model that receives a thin-section image as input and outputs its corresponding carbonate lithology class, from the following categories:

* ESF — Esferulitito (Spherulitic)
* ETR — Estromatólito (Stromatolitic)
* RET — Retrabalhado (Reworked)
* LMT — Laminito (Laminated)

---

## Dataset Description

### Training Set

* 1,100 synthetic carbonate thin-section images
* Resolution: 256×256
* Labels encoded in filenames

### Test Set

* 446 images
* Resolution: 512×512
* No labels provided

The dataset was built using a GAN model trained on real Petrobras petrographic data, enabling the generation of realistic carbonate textures.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess model performance, we compute:

* Confusion Matrix (raw)
* Confusion Matrix (normalized)
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Support per class

These metrics provide a complete view of performance across all lithologies.

---

## Main Goal

Primary objective: maximize **Accuracy** and **F1-Score**.
We implemented a two-phase Transfer Learning strategy with **ResNeXt-50**, combined with Weighted Sampling and Class Weight Boosting to mitigate class imbalance and improve minority-class recognition.

# 🎯 What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?

Petrographic interpretation is essential in carbonate reservoir characterization. However, distinguishing lithological textures manually can be time-consuming and subjective. Synthetic images produced by GANs introduce additional challenges due to variability and domain shift.

Our goal is to build a robust deep learning pipeline capable of reliably classifying carbonate lithologies from thin-section images—even under these constraints.

# 🖼️ Example of Synthetic Thin Sections

Below are examples of the type of synthetic carbonate thin-section images used in the training and testing phases.

# 🔬 Our Approach

We model the task as a supervised image classification problem:

[
f_\theta(I) \rightarrow y
]

Where

* ( I ) is a thin-section image
* ( y ) ∈ {ESF, ETR, RET, LMT}

### Key components of our pipeline:

### 🔹 Transfer Learning with ResNeXt-50

The model leverages pretrained ImageNet weights, allowing it to learn petrographic textures efficiently even with a limited dataset.

### 🔹 Handling Class Imbalance

* WeightedRandomSampler
* Class-weighted Cross-Entropy

These techniques significantly improve recall and F1-score for underrepresented lithologies.

### 🔹 Robust Evaluation

We analyze both macro and per-class performance through precision, recall, F1, and confusion matrices.

# ⚙️ Model Architecture

ResNeXt-50 acts as the backbone of the classifier.

The final output layer is replaced with a 4-class linear head:

[
\hat{y} = \text{Softmax}(W h + b)
]

Where

* ( h ) is the global pooled feature vector
* ( W, b ) are trainable parameters for lithology prediction

This architecture balances accuracy, capacity, and computational efficiency.

# 🧠 Training Strategy

Training involves:

* Cross-Entropy Loss with class weighting
* Adam optimizer with warmup + cosine decay
* Augmentations: rotations, flips, color jitter
* Weighted Sampling to rebalance batches

This strategy enhances generalization to the unlabeled 512×512 test set.
