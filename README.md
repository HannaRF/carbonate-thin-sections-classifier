# carbonate-thin-sections-classifier
Deep learning model for classifying carbonate petrographic thin-section images. Developed for the AI for Oil &amp; Gas Hackathon (CBPF + Petrobras), the project identifies four lithology classes: Spherulitic, Stromatolitic, Reworked, and Laminated, using synthetic GAN-generated images trained on real Petrobras data.
